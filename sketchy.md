Marine nitrogen (N 2) fixation is important in the global biogeo chemical cycling of N, and the interlinked cycling of carbon (C). Understanding and predicting global marine N 2 fixation requires information on diazotroph species specific rates of growth and N2 fixation, their biogeography, and the physiology of nutrient limitation in diazotrophs and nondiazotrophs (for the basis of competition in models). Because many diazotrophs are not easily visualized or quantified and many are yet uncultivated, the application of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods to amplify the nifH gene, which encodes nitrogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes N2 fixation, have led to multiple discoveries including new microorganisms (Zehr et al. 1998; Zehr and Capone 2020). Moreover, use of quantitative PCR (qPCR) has revealed unexpected biogeography of key marine diazotrophs regionally and globally (Church et al. 2005; Bentzon-Tilia et al. 2015; Langlois et al. 2015; Messer et al. 2015; Shiozaki et al. 2017; Harding et al. 2018; Mulholland et al. 2019). Biogeochemical modeling approaches have also been invaluable for providing hypothetical dynamic biogeography of the biomass associated with size classes of diazotrophs based on a number of assumptions (e.g., growth, nutrient uptake characteristics, and mortality; Dutkiewicz et al. 2014). It is, however, difficult to validate these models since there are few comprehensive datasets of N2-fixing organism biogeography.



Nitrogen gas (N2 ) fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs) are one of the most ecologically important functional guilds on Earth, providing the primary natural source for nitrogen to ecosystems through biological N2 fixation (BNF; Fowler et al., 2013). Isotopic evidence suggests that BNF has emerged as early as ca. 3.2 Gyr ago (Stüeken et al., 2015). It is thought to have evolved in an anaerobic archaeon and was later transferred to an aerobic bacterium (Boyd et al., 2015)



We investigated dinitrogen (­N2) fixation activity and diazotroph community composition across the Cape Verde Frontal Zone



The global nitrogen inventory is set by the balance between ﬁxed nitrogen gains in the form of biological dinitrogen (N2) ﬁxation and losses due to denitriﬁcation and annamox, but current measurements of both processes involve large uncertainties (Landolﬁ et al. 2018). Nitrogen availability fuels the biological carbon pump in otherwise nitrogen-limited systems such as subtropical gyres (Karl et al. 2012), and hence boost the ability of the oceans to cope with excess CO2 (Hutchins and Fu 2017). Thus, an accurate estimate of N2 ﬁxation is key to assessing the global ocean’s nitrogen inventory and its role in climate regulation. N2 ﬁxation represents a central reactive nitrogen supply in warm oligotrophic ocean regions, such as the subtropical gyres (Mahaffey et al. 2005), where dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations are typically close to the detection limit and surface temperatures exceed 20 C year round (Luo et al. 2012). Nutrient-rich coastal shelf seas and temperate estuaries were, however, long thought to lack signiﬁcant diazotrophic activity due to the prevalence of nitrogen-rich inputs from rivers, watershed runoff, and anthropogenic nutrient loading



Biological dinitrogen (N2) fixation, the reduction of atmospheric N2 to ammonia, is important for maintaining the fertility of the oceans by providing biologically useful nitrogen to support primary organic matter production (i.e., carbon dioxide fixation). N2 fixation offsets the removal of combined nitrogen by microbial denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) and export to the deep sea

Understanding the balance of the N cycle in the sea has wide-ranging implications for past, current, and future foodwebs, as well as for the role of marine N2 fixation in the sequestration of atmospheric CO2 and the production and consumption of other greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide.

Heterotrophic marine diazotrophs are diverse but have not yet been definitively shown to fix N2 or to contribute substantially to water column N2 fixation.
