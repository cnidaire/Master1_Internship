	abstract = {Primary productivity in the sunlit surface layers of tropical oceans is mostly limited by the supply of reactive nitrogen (Nr) through upwelling, N2 fixation by diazotrophs, riverine flux and atmospheric deposition. The relative importance of these processes varies from region to region. Using recent data on the nitrogen content of aerosols over the ocean and marine new production in parts of the northern Indian Ocean for the period 1994–2006 CE, a quantitative assessment of the contribution of atmospheric deposition to new production in the two biogeochemically different basins of the northern Indian Ocean, viz., the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, is presented. By suitably converting the measured concentrations of aerosol nitrogen into fluxes and comparing them with 15N tracer-based direct new and primary production measurements, it is inferred that the contribution of atmospheric deposition to new production in the northern Indian Ocean could at best be ∼3\%. Our estimate of ∼1.39 Tg N year−1 of Nr flux into the northern Indian Ocean through aerosols is a step toward significantly reducing the uncertainty in the global nitrogen budget.},

	abstract = {Diazotrophic microorganisms introduce biologically available nitrogen (N) to the global N cycle through the activity of the nitrogenase enzyme. The genetically conserved dinitrogenase reductase (nifH) gene is phylogenetically distributed across four clusters (I–IV) and is widely used as a marker gene for N2 fixation, permitting investigators to study the genetic diversity of diazotrophs in nature and target potential participants in N2 fixation. To date there have been limited, standardized pipelines for analyzing the nifH functional gene, which is in stark contrast to the 16S rRNA gene. Here we present a bioinformatics pipeline for processing nifH amplicon datasets – NifMAP (“NifH MiSeq Illumina Amplicon Analysis Pipeline”), which as a novel aspect uses Hidden-Markov Models to filter out homologous genes to nifH. By using this pipeline, we evaluated the broadly inclusive primer pairs (Ueda19F–R6, IGK3–DVV, and F2–R6) that target the nifH gene. To evaluate any systematic biases, the nifH gene was amplified with the aforementioned primer pairs in a diverse collection of environmental samples (soils, rhizosphere and roots samples, biological soil crusts and estuarine samples), in addition to a nifH mock community consisting of six phylogenetically diverse members. We noted that all primer pairs co-amplified nifH homologs to varying degrees; up to 90\% of the amplicons were nifH homologs with IGK3–DVV in some samples (rhizosphere and roots from tall oat-grass). In regards to specificity, we observed some degree of bias across the primer pairs. For example, primer pair F2–R6 discriminated against cyanobacteria (amongst others), yet captured many sequences from subclusters IIIE and IIIL-N. These aforementioned subclusters were largely missing by the primer pair IGK3–DVV, which also tended to discriminate against Alphaproteobacteria, but amplified sequences within clusters IIIC (affiliated with Clostridia) and clusters IVB and IVC. Primer pair Ueda19F–R6 exhibited the least bias and successfully captured diazotrophs in cluster I and subclusters IIIE, IIIL, IIIM, and IIIN, but tended to discriminate against Firmicutes and subcluster IIIC. Taken together, our newly established bioinformatics pipeline, NifMAP, along with our systematic evaluations of nifH primer pairs permit more robust, high-throughput investigations of diazotrophs in diverse environments.},

	abstract = {We investigated dinitrogen (N2) fixation activity and diazotroph community composition across the Cape Verde Frontal Zone (CVFZ), from photic epipelagic waters (0-200 m) to aphotic meso- (200–1000 m) and bathypelagic ({\textgreater} 1000 m) waters. The highest N2 fixation rates of 4.1 ± 2.2 nmol N l− 1 day− 1 and 7.8 ± 2.3 nmol N l− 1 day− 1 were in epipelagic waters south of the front. We detected aphotic N2 fixation in 5 out of 32 samples, primarily south of the front, and sporadically down to 3,000 m, with rates ranging from 0.03 ± 0.01 nmol N l− 1 day− 1 to 0.07 ± 0.01 nmol N l− 1 day− 1. Cyanobacteria dominated the diazotroph community and nitrogenase gene (nifH) expression profiles in surface waters and, surprisingly, in aphotic waters. The detection of cyanobacterial nifH genes by DNA sequencing and quantitative PCR in the aphotic zone, together with nifH expression in meso- and bathypelagic waters, indicates a downward flux of metabolically active cyanobacteria, and points to a contribution to the observed aphotic N2 fixation rates. In the photic zone, UCYN-A dominated north of the front, whereas Trichodesmium was mainly found in the southern region. However, our results also show that cross-frontal advection of cyanobacterial diazotrophs can occur via intrusions of surface water. Salinity, temperature, and mixed layer depth were the main determinants of the diazotroph composition and distribution of the key cyanobacteria. Thus, the front appeared to act as a dynamic barrier controlling the distribution of cyanobacterial diazotrophs.},

	volume = {67},
	doi = {10.1002/lno.11997},
	abstract = {Estuaries receive substantial anthropogenic nitrogen loading and are mainly considered net nitrogen sinks. While several studies have identified diverse diazotrophic communities in estuarine sediments, the role of pelagic diazotrophs in these systems is not well understood. We investigated the links between diazotrophic community composition, nitrogenase (nifH) gene expression, N2 fixation, and environmental conditions in Narragansett Bay (USA). Pelagic N2 fixation rates ranged between 0.02 and 9.41 nmol N L−1 d−1 and correlated significantly with fluctuations in diazotroph community composition. These fluctuations were also correlated with temperature, salinity, and mean sea level. The dominant sequences in our pelagic samples were related to sequences previously detected in the bay's sediments and were dominated by nifH gene Clusters I and III. We interpret this as a coupling between sediment and pelagic diazotroph communities and speculate that resuspension plays an important role for pelagic N2 fixation in shallow estuarine environments such as Narragansett Bay. For instance, the finding of active sulfate reducers in the oxygenated water illustrates that the sediment-pelagic coupling can impact nutrient cycling in shallow environments. The pelagic N2 fixation measured during our study period showed only a minor contribution ({\textless} 1\%) to the total estimated nitrogen load to Narragansett Bay. However, with intensifying nitrogen management in estuaries, the need to constrain the rates of pelagic N2 fixation in these systems will be essential for estimating nitrogen fluxes within the bay and to the adjacent coastal ecosystems.},

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btu417},
	abstract = {Motivation: 
Studies of the biochemical functions and activities of uncultivated microorganisms in the environment require analysis of DNA sequences for phylogenetic characterization and for the development of sequence-based assays for the detection of microorganisms. The numbers of sequences for genes that are indicators of environmentally important functions such as nitrogen (N2) fixation have been rapidly growing over the past few decades. Obtaining these sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology Information's GenBank database is problematic because of annotation errors, nomenclature variation and paralogues; moreover, GenBank's structure and tools are not conducive to searching solely by function. For some genes, such as the nifH gene commonly used to assess community potential for N2 fixation, manual collection and curation are becoming intractable because of the large number of sequences in GenBank and the large number of highly similar paralogues. If analysis is to keep pace with sequence discovery, an automated retrieval and curation system is necessary.

Results:
ARBitrator uses a two-step process composed of a broad collection of potential homologues followed by screening with a best hit strategy to conserved domains. 34 420 nifH sequences were identified in GenBank as of November 20, 2012. The false-positive rate is ∼0.033\%. ARBitrator rapidly updates a public nifH sequence database, and we show that it can be adapted for other genes.

Results confirmed that the DNA sequence of the 359-bp segment is sufficiently variable to distinguish cyanobacterial nifH genes from other eubacterial and arachaeobacterial nifH genes, as well as to distinguish heterocystous from nonheterocystous nifH genes. Nonheterocystous cyanobacterial nifH sequences were greater than 70 and 82\% identical on the DNA and amino acid levels, respectively, whereas corresponding values for heterocystous cyanobacterial nifH sequences were 84 and 91\%. The amplified nifH fragments can be used as DNA probes to differentiate between species, although there was substantial cross-reactivity between the nifH amplification products of some strains. However, an oligonucleotide designed from a sequence conserved within the heterocystous cyanobacteria hybridized primarily with the amplification product from heterocystous strains. The use of oligonucleotides designed from amplified nifH sequences shows great promise for characterizing assemblages of diazotrophs.},

Analysis of 30 nitrogenase DNA and deduced amino acid sequences from cyanobacteria representing five major taxonomic subdivisions showed great variation in phylogenetic distances between the sequences. Sequences from heterocystous cyanobacteria formed a coherent cluster, in which branching forms did not form a clade distinct from the non-branching forms. Nitrogenase sequences from the unicellular cyanobacteria Gloeothece and Synechococcus sp. RF-1 formed a cluster, as did sequences from the genera Xenococcus and Myxosarcina. The nifH sequences of filamentous nonheterocystous cyanobacteria were not closely related to each other, forming deep branches with respect to the heterocystous cyanobacterial nifH sequences. The phylogeny of nifH based on amino acid sequences was consistent with taxonomic relationships among the strains; for example, a sequence obtained form a natural assemblage believed to be dominated by 'Lyngbya' clustered with nifH from Lyngbya lagerheimii. Results also indicate that the phylogeny of nifH among the cyanobacteria is largely consistent with the phylogeny of 16S rRNA, and furthermore that the nifH sequence can be used to identify uncultivated strains of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria.},

The database includes 185 linked multigene entries including full-length nifH, nifD, nifK and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences. Evolutionary analyses enabled by the multigene entries support an ancient horizontal transfer of nitrogenase genes between Archaea and Bacteria and provide evidence that nifH has a different history of horizontal gene transfer from the nifDK enzyme core. Further analyses show that lineages in nitrogenase cluster I and cluster III have different rates of substitution within nifD, suggesting that nifD is under different selection pressure in these two lineages. Finally, we find that that the genetic divergence of nifH and 16S rRNA genes does not correlate well at sequence dissimilarity values used commonly to define microbial species, as stains having {\textless}3\% sequence dissimilarity in their 16S rRNA genes can have up to 23\% dissimilarity in nifH.

Microorganisms catalyse biological nitrogen fixation with the enzyme nitrogenase, which has been highly conserved through evolution. Cloning and sequencing of one of the nitrogenase structural genes, nifH, has provided a large, rapidly expanding database of sequences from diverse terrestrial and aquatic environments. Comparison of nifH phylogenies to ribosomal RNA phylogenies from cultivated microorganisms shows little conclusive evidence of lateral gene transfer. Sequence diversity far outstrips representation by cultivated representatives. The phylogeny of nitrogenase includes branches that represent phylotypic groupings based on ribosomal RNA phylogeny, but also includes paralogous clades including the alternative, non-molybdenum, non-vanadium containing nitrogenases. Only a few alternative or archaeal nitrogenase sequences have as yet been obtained from the environment. Extensive analysis of the distribution of nifH phylotypes among habitats indicates that there are characteristic patterns of nitrogen fixing microorganisms in termite guts, sediment and soil environments, estuaries and salt marshes, and oligotrophic oceans. The distribution of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms, although not entirely dictated by the nitrogen availability in the environment, is non-random and can be predicted on the basis of habitat characteristics. The ability to assay for gene expression and investigate genome arrangements provides the promise of new tools for interrogating natural populations of diazotrophs. The broad analysis of nitrogenase genes provides a basis for developing molecular assays and bioinformatics approaches for the study of nitrogen fixation in the environment.},

Until now, cyanobacterial populations have been viewed as the main suppliers of bioavailable nitrogen in this habitat. Although PCR amplicon surveys targeting the nitrogenase reductase gene have revealed the existence of diverse non-cyanobacterial diazotrophic populations, subsequent quantitative PCR surveys suggest that they generally occur in low abundance. Here, we use state-of-the-art metagenomic assembly and binning strategies to recover nearly one thousand non-redundant microbial population genomes from the TARA Oceans metagenomes. Among these, we provide the first genomic evidence for non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs inhabiting surface waters of the open ocean, which correspond to lineages within the Proteobacteria and, most strikingly, the Planctomycetes. Members of the latter phylum are prevalent in aquatic systems, but have never been linked to nitrogen fixation previously. Moreover, using genome-wide quantitative read recruitment, we demonstrate that the discovered diazotrophs were not only widespread but also remarkably abundant (up to 0.3\% of metagenomic reads for a single population) in both the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean northwest. Our results extend decades of PCR-based gene surveys, and substantiate the importance of heterotrophic bacteria in the fixation of nitrogen in the surface ocean.},

However, there is resistance to adopting a single framework to preserve taxonomic freedom, and ever increasing numbers of genomes derived from uncultured prokaryotes threaten to overwhelm current nomenclatural practices, which are based on characterised isolates. The challenge ahead then is to reach a consensus on the taxonomic framework and to adapt and scale the existing nomenclatural code, or create a new code, to systematically incorporate uncultured taxa into the chosen framework.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen fixation is a key component of the nitrogen cycle, one of the most fundamental cycles in the biosphere. Conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into organic nitrogen compounds can be carried out only by certain bacteria and blue-green algae (cyanobacteria). Some nitrogen fixing bacteria live symbiotically with leguminous plants such as peas, beans, clover, and certain tropical trees in nodules on the plants' roots, while others live independently in the soil and aquatic habitats. By the activity of these microorganisms, the soil is enriched with the nitrogen required for plant growth and function. Thus the topic is of considerable practical as well as fundamental importance. In Biological Nitrogen Fixation, the leading researchers in nitrogen fixation from all over the world contribute up-to-the-minute general reviews on all aspects of the subject, from the molecular biology and genetics to the biochemistry, physiology, and ecology of nitrogen fixation. This compendium of current research is an indispensable reference for all involved in nitrogen fixation research, and of use to all who deal indirectly with the subject. It will also serve as a thoroughly up-to-date textbook for graduate students in microbiology, plant science, biochemistry, molecular biology, plant pathology, agronomy, and genetics.},

	abstract = {The dominant process adding nitrogen (N) to the ocean, di-nitrogen (N2) fixation, is mediated by prokaryotes (diazotrophs) sensitive to a variety of environmental factors. In particular, it is often assumed that consequential rates of marine N2 fixation do not occur where concentrations of nitrate (NO−3) and/or ammonium (NH+4) exceed 1μM because of the additional energetic cost associated with assimilating N2 gas relative to NO−3 or NH+4. However, an examination of culturing studies and in situ N2 fixation rate measurements from marine euphotic, mesopelagic, and benthic environments indicates that while elevated concentrations of NO−3 and/or NH+4 can depress N2 fixation rates, the process can continue at substantial rates in the presence of as much as 30μM NO−3 and/or 200μM NH+4. These findings challenge expectations of the degree to which inorganic N inhibits this process. The high rates of N2 fixation measured in some benthic environments suggest that certain benthic diazotrophs may be less sensitive to prolonged exposure to NO−3 and/or NH+4 than cyanobacterial diazotrophs. Additionally, recent work indicates that cyanobacterial diazotrophs may have mechanisms for mitigating NO−3 inhibition of N2 fixation. In particular, it has been recently shown that increasing phosphorus (P) availability increases diazotroph abundance, thus compensating for lower per-cell rates of N2 fixation that result from NO−3 inhibition. Consequently, low ambient surface ocean N:P ratios such as those generated by the increasing rates of N loss thought to occur during the last glacial to interglacial transition may create conditions favorable for N2 fixation and thus help to stabilize the marine N inventory on relevant time scales. These findings suggest that restricting measurements of marine N2 fixation to oligotrophic surface waters may underestimate global rates of this process and contribute to uncertainties in the marine N budget.},

	abstract = {We report a new synthesis of best estimates of the inputs of fixed nitrogen to the world ocean via atmospheric deposition and compare this to fluvial inputs and dinitrogen fixation. We evaluate the scale of human perturbation of these fluxes. Fluvial inputs dominate inputs to the continental shelf, and we estimate that about 75\% of this fluvial nitrogen escapes from the shelf to the open ocean. Biological dinitrogen fixation is the main external source of nitrogen to the open ocean, i.e., beyond the continental shelf. Atmospheric deposition is the primary mechanism by which land-based nitrogen inputs, and hence human perturbations of the nitrogen cycle, reach the open ocean. We estimate that anthropogenic inputs are currently leading to an increase in overall ocean carbon sequestration of 0.4\% (equivalent to an uptake of 0.15 Pg C yr−1 and less than the Duce et al. (2008) estimate). The resulting reduction in climate change forcing from this ocean CO2 uptake is offset to a small extent by an increase in ocean N2O emissions. We identify four important feedbacks in the ocean atmosphere nitrogen system that need to be better quantified to improve our understanding of the perturbation of ocean biogeochemistry by atmospheric nitrogen inputs. These feedbacks are recycling of (1) ammonia and (2) organic nitrogen from the ocean to the atmosphere and back, (3) the suppression of nitrogen fixation by increased nitrogen concentrations in surface waters from atmospheric deposition, and (4) increased loss of nitrogen from the ocean by denitrification due to increased productivity stimulated by atmospheric inputs.},

	abstract = {The photosynthetic cyanobacterium Trichodesmium is widely distributed in the surface low latitude ocean where it contributes significantly to N2 fixation and primary productivity. Previous studies found nifH genes and intact Trichodesmium colonies in the sunlight-deprived meso- and bathypelagic layers of the ocean (200–4000 m depth). Yet, the ability of Trichodesmium to fix N2 in the dark ocean has not been explored. We performed 15N2 incubations in sediment traps at 170, 270 and 1000 m at two locations in the South Pacific. Sinking Trichodesmium colonies fixed N2 at similar rates than previously observed in the surface ocean (36–214 fmol N cell−1 d−1). This activity accounted for 40 ± 28\% of the bulk N2 fixation rates measured in the traps, indicating that other diazotrophs were also active in the mesopelagic zone. Accordingly, cDNA nifH amplicon sequencing revealed that while Trichodesmium accounted for most of the expressed nifH genes in the traps, other diazotrophs such as Chlorobium and Deltaproteobacteria were also active. Laboratory experiments simulating mesopelagic conditions confirmed that increasing hydrostatic pressure and decreasing temperature reduced but did not completely inhibit N2 fixation in Trichodesmium. Finally, using a cell metabolism model we predict that Trichodesmium uses photosynthesis-derived stored carbon to sustain N2 fixation while sinking into the mesopelagic. We conclude that sinking Trichodesmium provides ammonium, dissolved organic matter and biomass to mesopelagic prokaryotes.},

	abstract = {The oceanic dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) pool is mainly composed of P-esters and, to a lesser extent, equally abundant phosphonate and P-anhydride molecules. In phosphate-limited ocean regions, diazotrophs are thought to rely on DOP compounds as an alternative source of phosphorus (P). While both P-esters and phosphonates effectively promote dinitrogen (N2) fixation, the role of P-anhydrides for diazotrophs is unknown. Here we explore the effect of P-anhydrides on N2 fixation at two stations with contrasting biogeochemical conditions: one located in the Tonga trench volcanic arc region (“volcano,” with low phosphate and high iron concentrations), and the other in the South Pacific Gyre (“gyre,” with moderate phosphate and low iron). We incubated surface seawater with AMP (P-ester), ATP (P-ester and P-anhydride), or 3polyP (P-anhydride) and determined cell-specific N2 fixation rates, nifH gene abundance, and transcription in Crocosphaera and Trichodesmium. Trichodesmium did not respond to any DOP compounds added, suggesting that they were not P-limited at the volcano station and were outcompeted by the low iron conditions at the gyre station. Conversely, Crocosphaera were numerous at both stations and their specific N2 fixation rates were stimulated by AMP at the volcano station and slightly by 3polyP at both stations. Heterotrophic bacteria responded to ATP and 3polyP additions similarly at both stations, despite the contrasting phosphate and iron availability. The use of 3polyP by Crocosphaera and heterotrophic bacteria at both low and moderate phosphate concentrations suggests that this compound, in addition to being a source of P, can be used to acquire energy for which both groups compete. P-anhydrides may thus leverage energy restrictions to diazotrophs in the future stratified and nutrient-impoverished ocean.},
